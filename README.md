Overview:
This repo contains my final project, which is an SPA hosted on firebase. The page
leverage https://api.aerisapi.com/. 

WARNING: 
The API is a rich source of weather data and I leveraged a 30 day trial, beginning at the start of July 2020. The SPA will no longer work shortly after that point.

App Function/Directions:
Enter any valid US zipcode and the weather data will populate in 7 cards below, showing the next 7 days of weather. Missing zipcode or erroneous zip code should trigger a warning in a grey highlight.

Weathre will include data elements such as temp high/low, humidity, percipitation %, and a weather summary with logos to match.
